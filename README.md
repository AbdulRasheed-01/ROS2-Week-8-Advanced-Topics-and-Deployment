📚 Theory Content

Key Concepts:

Component	          |      Description	                         |     Use Case

Micro-ROS Agent	    |      Bridge between micro-ROS and ROS 2	   |     Runs on Linux, connects to MCU

XRCE Client	        |      XRCE-DDS protocol implementation	     |     Runs on MCU, communicates with agent

Memory Pool	        |      Pre-allocated memory for real-time	   |     Ensures deterministic behavior

Static Allocator	  |      No dynamic memory allocation	         |     Safety-critical systems
